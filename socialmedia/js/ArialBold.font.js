 * Description:
 * Contemporary sans serif design, Arial contains more humanist characteristics
 * than many of its predecessors and as such is more in tune with the mood of the
 * last decades of the twentieth century.  The overall treatment of curves is
 * softer and fuller than in most industrial style sans serif faces.  Terminal
 * strokes are cut on the diagonal which helps to give the face a less mechanical
 * appearance.  Arial is an extremely versatile family of typefaces which can be
 * used with equal success for text setting in reports, presentations, magazines
 * etc, and for display use in newspapers, advertising and promotions.
