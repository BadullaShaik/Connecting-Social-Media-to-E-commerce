              <p>In recent years, the boundaries between e-commerce and social networking have become increasingly blurred. Many
e-commerce websites support the mechanism of social login where users can sign on the websites using their social network identities
such as their Facebook or Twitter accounts. Users can also post their newly purchased products on microblogs with links to the
e-commerce product web pages. A major challenge is how to leverage knowledge extracted from social networking sites for cross-site

        <p><strong>Cross-site cold-start product recommendation</strong></p>
        <p>We propose a novel solution for cross-site cold-start product recommendation, which 
            aims to recommend products from e-commerce websites to users at social networking sites in “cold-start” situations, a problem which 
        has rarely been explored before.</p>

          <p>A major challenge is how to leverage knowledge extracted from social networking sites for cross-site 
          cold-start product recommendation.In our problem setting here, only the users’ social networking 
          information is available and it is a challenging task 
          to transform the social networking information into latent 
          user features which can be effectively used for product recommendation.</p>
          <p>We propose to use the linked users across social networking sites and e-commerce websites as a bridge to map users’ social 
          networking features to another feature representation for product recommendation.</p>
